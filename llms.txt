## Topics & Themes

The show focuses on practical, experience-driven insights rather than motivational platitudes. Key themes include:

1. **Early-stage go-to-market** — Finding product-market fit, distribution channels, and organic growth tactics
2. **SEO and search presence** — Technical SEO, content strategy, and ranking in AI-powered search
3. **Startup failure patterns** — Why companies fail, ethical drift, and the gap between rhetoric and reality
4. **Digital reputation** — Managing search results, handling negative press, and controlling your narrative
5. **Founder psychology** — The mental pressures of entrepreneurship and avoiding destructive patterns

## Philosophy

Drew's approach centers on **candid entrepreneurship critique**. He rejects "fake it 'til you make it" culture and examines the psychological pressures that drive founders to make questionable decisions. His framework, "The Six Deadly Sins of Entrepreneurship," explores how ambition can lead to ethical compromise.

The show aims to bridge the gap between startup hype and sustainable business practice, using personal failure as a teaching tool rather than a badge of honor.
